## Note on Asynchronous Processing
Chat responses are processed asynchronously. After submitting a query, you'll need to poll the status endpoint until the response is complete.

## Expected Response Time
Response times may vary depending on the complexity of the query. Implement appropriate UI feedback for users during this wait time.

## Error Handling
Implement robust error handling in the frontend, especially for network issues or longer processing times.

## Scope of Information
CosmicForge AI Chatbot provides information on general medical topics, health lifestyles, treatments, and medications. It does not provide personalized medical diagnoses or replace professional medical advice.
